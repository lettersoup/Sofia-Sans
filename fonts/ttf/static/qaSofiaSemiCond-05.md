* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

The following glyphs do not have the recommended number of contours:

* [com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/ligature_carets)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret
rendering.

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard
shortcut.

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled
by ufo2ft, and therefore will not build via FontMake. See
googlefonts/ufo2ft/issues/329

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg

<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of
Windows recognize it as a valid font file, we must make sure that the
concatenated length of the familyname (NameID.FONT_FAMILY_NAME) and style
(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20
characters.

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test detects line segments which are nearly, but not quite, exactly
horizontal or vertical. Sometimes such lines are created by design, but often
they are indicative of a design error.

This test is disabled for italic styles, which often contain nearly-upright
lines.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, the test also checks for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.

Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design
may call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this test is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, the test will pass if there
are more than 100 reported misalignments.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions
defined in the GDEF table, otherwhise, users may experience issues with caret

If using GlyphsApp, ligature carets can be set directly on canvas by accessing
the `Glyph -&gt; Set Anchors` menu option or by pressing the `Cmd+U` keyboard

If designing with UFOs, (as of Oct 2020) ligature carets are not yet compiled

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of

(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint.

<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, the test also checks for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.

Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design
may call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this test is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, the test will pass if there
are more than 100 reported misalignments.

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will
only differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.

However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a
display family.

This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This check inspects the glyph outlines and detects the total number of contours in each of them. The expected values are infered from the typical ammounts of contours observed in a large collection of reference font families. The divergences listed below may simply indicate a significantly different design on some of your glyphs. On the other hand, some of these may flag actual bugs in the font such as glyphs mapped to an incorrect codepoint. Please consider reviewing the design and codepoint assignment of these to make sure they are correct.

All ligatures in a font must have corresponding caret (text cursor) positions

According to a GlyphsApp tutorial [1], in order to make sure all versions of

(NameID.FONT_SUBFAMILY_NAME) strings in the name table do not exceed 20

After discussing the problem in more detail at `FontBakery issue #2179 [2] we
decided that allowing up to 27 chars would still be on the safe side, though.
